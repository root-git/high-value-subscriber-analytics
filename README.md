# Customer Analytics: Identifying High-Value Subscribers
## Overview
This project analyzes a real-world consumer subscription dataset to identify high-potential customers for a subscription service. It involves data cleaning, exploration, and segmentation to provide insights for marketing and retention.

The original dataset was messy, with undefined columns, test records, and missing values. This reflects the type of raw, imperfect data analysts often encounter in production. 

## Why This Project Matters
Retenton is critical for subscription-based startups. Acquiring a new customer can cost 5-25x more than retaining one, yet many early-stage companies struggle to target the right customer types and marketing channels drive the most value is key to growing sustainably.

This project shows my ability to:
* Turn messy, incomplete data into actionable insights.
* Bridge data science and business strategy to guide marketing and growth decisions.

## Key Steps
1. ### Data Cleaning & Preparation
* Removed test records and irrelevant identifiers (name, address, etc.).
* Standardized values across non-numerical columns.
* Handled missing values across all columns.

2. ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyzed customer acquisition channels (original traffic sources and referring sites) for profitability and efficiency.
* Explored customer characteristics including gender and subscription status, and their correlation with customer value.
* Investigated the influence of initial content engagement on revenue.
* Segmented customers by revenue tiers.
* Compared characteristics across revenue tiers, acquisition channels, and gender.

## Challenges & Learnings
* Messy real-world data: Required careful assumptions and data cleaning before modeling.
* Feature gaps: Limited variables restricted predictive power, highlighted importance of high-quality data pipelines in analytics engineering.
* Interpretability: Even with moderate accuracy, the project demonstrates how to extract actionable insights for acquiring high potential customers.
