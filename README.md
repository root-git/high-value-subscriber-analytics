# Customer Analytics: Identifying High-Value Subscribers
## Overview
This project analyzes a real-world consumer subscription dataset to identify high-potential customers for a subscription service. It involves data cleaning, exploration, and segmentation to provide insights for marketing and retention.

The original dataset was messy, with undefined columns, test records, and missing values. This reflects the type of raw, imperfect data analysts often encounter in production. The project demostrates my ability to clean messy data, extract signal from noise, and build predictive models despite limitations.

## Key Steps
1. ### Data Cleaning & Preparation
* Removed test records and irrelevant identifiers (name, address, etc.).
* Standardized values across non-numerical columns.
* Handled missing values across all columns.

2. ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Analyzed customer acquisition channels (original traffic sources and referring sites) for profitability and efficiency.
* Explored customer characteristics including gender and subscription status, and their correlation with customer value.
* Investigated the influence of initial content engagement on revenue.
* Segmented customers by revenue tiers.
* Compared characteristics across revenue tiers, acquisition channels, and gender.

## Challenges & Learnings
* Messy real-world data: Required careful assumptions and data cleaning before modeling.
* Feature gaps: Limited variables restricted predictive power, highlighted importance of high-quality data pipelines in analytics engineering.
* Interpretability: Even with moderate accuracy, the project demonstrates how to extract actionable insights for acquiring high potential customers.

## Why This Project Matters
Companies with subscription model live or die by retention. This project shows my ability to:
* Work with messy, incomplete data and still deliver insights.
* Bridge data science + business thinking.
